\section{Introduction}

The formation and evolution of planets and their attendant moons is thought to occur in the first few ten million years of the stellar system \hl{REF}.
%
Comets deliver volatiles across menay different distances within the Solar system, from the outermost reaches of the Oort cloud in to the terrestrial planets.
%
It is therefore important to understand the distribution, nature and chemical composition of exocomets in other planet forming systems.

One of the closest young systems is Beta Pictoris, which has been studied intensively both with direct imaging and with spectroscopy.

Beta Pictoris is a young, early type star whose stellar chromosphreic lines show rotational broadening of 200 km/s \hl{REF}.
%
Additional, much narrower absorption features are seen in the Calcium H and K lines.
%
These features appear and disappear on several hour long timescales, and show a different range of morphologies \hl{[REF]}.
%
Intensive spectroscopic monitoring over several hours show changes of radial velocity of these components consistent with elliptical orbits.
%
The absorption is hypothesised to be due to the evaporation of infalling bodies that pass within a few stellar radii of the star, resulting in sublimation of metals that produce a large coma containing the Calcium atoms which are then seen as an additional absorption component \hl{[REF REF]}.

From the multiple detections of exocomets in spectroscopy towards Beta Pictoris, the broadband detection of exocomet tails transiting a star were seen initially detected towards the star KIC~3542116 \citep{Rappaport18} with the Kepler satellite [REF] and subsequently detected in TESS data towards Beta Pictoris \citep{Zieba19}.
%
Observations of Beta Pictoris in subsequent TESS sector revealed over two dozen transits whost depth follows a power law distribution similar to those of the Solar system \citep{LecavelierdesEtangs22,Pavlenko22}.



%Short Beta pic description, previous detection of species in optical (CaII, NaI, FeI).


To the contrary of what is observed in the case of \ac{feb}, most molecular and atomic signatures detected in the coma of Solar system comets are emission lines/bands instead of absorptions.

Spectroscopic observations of Solar system comets when they are very close to the Sun are rare due to observational difficulties.
%
%The only comet spectroscopically observed closer than 0.2~au from the Sun is C/1965~S1 Ikeya-Seki.
%
%For this comet, it was noticed that the main emission bands/lines detected in its optical spectrum dramatically changed while the comet approached the Sun.
%
%At distances greater than 0.4~au, \ce{CH}, \ce{CN}, \ce{C2}, and \ce{C3} emission bands dominated the spectrum, but at 0.15 au from the Sun, the only molecular emission detected was \ce{CN}, while numerous atomic lines were visible \citep[\ce{[\ion{O}{i}], \ion{Na}{i}, \ion{K}{i}, \ion{Ca}{ii}, \ion{Cr}{i}, \ion{Mn}{i}, \ion{Fe}{i}, \ion{Ni}{i}, \ion{Cu}{i}, \ion{V}{i}; ][]{Dufay65,Thackeray1966,Preston1967,Slaughter1969}.
%%\ion{Ca}{ii} and \ion{Fe}{i} have only been spectroscopically observed via emission lines in the sun-grazing comet C/1965~S1 Ikeya-Seki.
%
For this comet, it was noticed that the main emission bands/lines detected in its optical spectrum dramatically changed while the comets approached the Sun.
%
At distances greater than 0.4~au, \ce{CH}, \ce{CN}, \ce{C2}, and \ce{C3} emission bands dominated the spectrum.
%
However, at 0.15~au from the Sun, the only molecular emission detected was \ce{CN}, while numerous atomic lines were visible \citep[\ion{[O]}{i}, \ion{Na}{i}, \ion{K}{i}, \ion{Ca}{ii}, \ion{Cr}{i}, \ion{Mn}{i}, \ion{Fe}{i}, \ion{Ni}{i}, \ion{Cu}{i}, \ion{V}{i}; ][]{Dufay65,Thackeray1966,Preston1967,Slaughter1969}.
%
Additionally, a tail of \ion{Fe}{i} atoms was proposed to explain a linear feature imaged in the tail of sungrazing comet C/2016~P1 McNaught 2006P1 \citep{Fulle2007}. 

On the other hand, \ion{Na}{i} D-line emission has been observed in many comets within $r \sim 1$ au of the Sun, where either the emission was much brighter than the foreground sky emission, or the comet was observed at high spectral resolution enabling separation from the telluric lines \hl{REFs}.
%
The high efficiency of the \ion{Na}{i} D transition makes it easily detectable, even for relatively low column density.
%
A notable discovery was a spectacular tail of \ion{Na}{i} associated with comet C/1995 O1 Hale-Bopp at $r\sim 1$ au, formed by radiation pressure on the neutral atoms before ionisation \citep{Cremonese1997}. 

These characteristics imply that \ion{Ca}{ii} and \ion{Fe}{i} are predominantly locked up within cometary dust gains, and only observed when a comet is close enough to the Sun to allow their sublimation.
%
This occurs at $r\leq 0.03-0.06$ au for a dust grain with Bond albedo $\sim0.01$ and a sublimation temperature of $T\simeq 1600$K, depending on the thermal model assumed.
%
On the other hand, the origin of the \ion{Na}{i} tail observed in numerous comets at larger distances from the Sun is still not very well understood \citep{Cremonese02}.
%
Release from dust grains as well as molecular processes have been suggested as possible sources of \ion{Na}{i} in the coma and tail of comets annd explain its presence at large solar distances \citep{Cremonese1997}.
%Na appears to be weakly bound to the dust grains and released at larger solar distances.

For the majority of Solar system comets, their optical spectra are dominated by the reflected sunlight from dust grains in their comae, plus molecular and atomic emission lines \citep[e.g. ][]{hyland2019}.
%
Most of the neutral and ionic molecular emission results from resonance fluorescence with solar photons. Some species, such as \ce{H2O+} and \ce{CO+} result from ionization of parent molecules (i.e. molecules released directly by the sublimation of nuclear ices), all other molecules observed are second generation species, often created via photodissociation of parent molecules or released by organic-rich grains in the coma.
%
Another process also observed in optical spectrum of comets is prompt atomic emission  ([\ion{O}{i}], [\ion{C}{i}], and [\ion{N}{i}]).
%
Those forbidden transitions are the result of atoms produced in an excited state by the photodissociation of parent molecules in the coma. 

Of all cometary gas emission, the highest signal to noise normally occurs with the \ce{CN} (0-0) band at $\lambda\simeq 3880$\AA.
%
It is usually the first emission detected in the optical spectrum of a comet as it approaches the Sun, and as been detected in the coma of comets observed at relatively large distances from the Sun \citep[e.g. ][]{Fitzsimmons1996}.
%
The relative abundance in the coma of most comets of \ce{CN/OH}$\simeq500$ \citep{AHearn1995}, together with its high fluorescence scattering efficiency factor of $\sim$ 2.6 photons/sec/molecule at 1~au from the Sun and $\dot{r}\simeq 0$ \citep{Schleicher2010}, gives rise to a clear signature of a cometary gas comae.
%
Historically, the \ce{CN} was believed to be created from photodissociation of \ce{HCN}, which is present in abundances of the order of 1\% relative to water in cometary ices.
%
High-spatial resolution sub-mm mapping of \ce{HCN} distributions supports a nuclear source in some comets \citep{Cordiner2014}.
%
However, it is now known that in many comets a substantial fraction of \ce{CN} is released from sub-micron dust grains in the inner coma of comets \citep[e.g. ][]{Fray2005}. 

The \ce{C2} (0-0) band at $\lambda\simeq 5160$\AA \ may be of comparable flux, but has a lower contrast with the underlying dust grain continuum due to its wider bandwidth.
%
The \ce{OH} (0-0) band at $\lambda\simeq 3080$ \AA \ generally has higher flux, but unless observed from space the high terrestrial atmospheric absorption severely diminishes the observed flux.
%
Strong \ce{CO+} emission bands have also been observed in a number of comets (the strongest ones are the (3-0) and (2-0) $\mathrm{A^2\Pi-X^2\Sigma}$) \hl{REFS}).
%
However this is normally significantly weaker than the observed \ce{CN} emission, with only \hl{number of comets} comets.

Given the ubiquitous signature of \ce{CN} emission in Solar system comets, we have embarked on an archival search for this species in the \ac{feb} around Beta Pic.
%
Detection of this species would provide a solid link between cometary bodies in our Solar system and the \bp{} system.

\section{Data description and analysis}

For the study in this paper, we use all the publicly available data from the \ac{harps} and the ESO 3.6m telescope in Chile.
%
In addition, we complement this with observations with the \ac{uves} at the Very Large Telescope in Chile. 

\subsection{HARPS observations}

We collated all publicly available HARPS observations of \bp{} obtained between October 2003 and \textcolor{red}{March 2020}.
%
Although these observations cover a large baseline, the time between visits varies between 1 day and $\sim$2.2 years.
%
Similarly, the number of observations per epoch spans a wide range, between \textcolor{red}{1 and 356} exposures, while the exposure times vary between \textcolor{red}{12 and 900} seconds. This results in a SNR range per exposure between \textcolor{red}{NNNN and MMMM}, and a nightly SNR between \textcolor{red}{NNNN and MMMM}.
%
To avoid potential edge effects from order merging,  we used the E2DS files downloaded directly from the ESO archive for our analysis.

\textcolor{red}{Q: Do we want to put an observing log in the appendix?}
\textcolor{red}{Q: Do we want to attempt to use the S1D, as they may have less issues with wiggles if the blaze profile was removed.}



\subsection{UVES observations}

To supplement the HARPS observations, we use 160 epochs of \ac{uves} observations obtained between 01 April, 2017 and April 18, 2018 under programme 599.C-0751.
%
The details for these observations are given in \cite{vansluijs2019}, and summarised here.
%
These observations were all obtained using the same instrument setup.
%
We used the standard 437+760 mode of \ac{uves}, which uses the \#2 dichroic to allow simultaneous observations in both the red and blue arm.
%
In this mode, the CD\#2 and CD\#4 cross-dispersers are used in the blue and red-arm, respectively, providing a simultaneous wavelength coverage of $\sim 3730$ \AA{} to $\sim 5000$ \AA{} in the blue arm, and $\sim 5650$ \AA{} to $\sim 9560$ \AA{} in the red arm.
%
For the remainder of the paper, we will only focus on the data from the blue arm of \ac{uves}, as this covers the strong \ce{CN} (0-0) band-head seen in Solar system comets.
%
For the blue arm, a 0.3''-wide slit was used to obtain the highest possible resolving power ($\sim$90,000 before an intervention on the instrument in October 2017, and $\sim$100,000 after the intervention). 

The data were reduced using the ESO \ac{uves} pipeline version \textcolor{red}{6.1.6} through ESO Reflex tool in order to provide as homogeneous a dataset as possible. The flat-field was applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis. \textcolor{red}{The pipeline was set to output the intermediate products and the blaze-corrected spectra before merging were used for our analysis, as the order-merging could introduce systematics in the overlap region. Optimal extraction was performed, using an empirical profile}

\subsection{Initial data processing}
Starting from the 2d spectra, the data from both instruments was processed in similar ways.
%
Each order was treated separately, with the main focus on orders \textcolor{red}{4 and 8} for HARPS and \textcolor{red}{4, and 7} for UVES as those orders contain the main CN bandhead as well as the \ion{Ca}{ii} H line, which are used to identify the exocomets.
%
All the spectra were transformed into the stellar rest-frame and onto a common wavelength grid using linear interpolation. For UVES, the \ce{Fe} \textcolor{red}{NNNN~$\AA$} line was used to track global wavelength drifts between different exposures which were corrected for at the same time. To measure these, a Gaussian was fit to the line, and the velocity offset from the restframe position determined. 

%
After all the spectra were all transformed into the stellar restframe, an average nightly spectrum was made from all spectra within a night for each of the nights of observations. This was done after correcting for variations in the effective blaze profile (e.g., due to instrumental changes, differential slit/fiber losses, atmospheric absorption etc.), as outlined below. Note that after this correction, the HARPS data still have the overall instrumental blaze-profile, while the 2d-spectra from UVES were already corrected for this.


\subsubsection{Effective Blaze function correction}\label{sect:blaze}

One of the nights with a high signal to noise was chosen to act as an initial estimate for the blaze function (the night of \textcolor{red}{DATE} for HARPS and \textcolor{red}{DATE} for UVES). The individual spectra in this night were averaged together to further boost the signal-to-noise ratio. Subsequently, each individual spectrum was divided by this reference spectrum to highlight the changes in the effective profile. This ratio spectrum was subsequently binned using a bin-width of \textcolor{red}{101} pixels using a robust algorithm to remove outliers within each bin. This binned ratio was than fit using a \textcolor{red}{second} order polynomial. The original spectrum was finally divided by this polynomial to correct for the changes.

Note that for HARPS, the change of fiber in June 2015 (JD$\sim$2,457,180) resulted in an overall change of the blaze profile, and therefore, the spectra before and after this date were separately post-processed as outlined below in the Sect.~/ref{sect:starcor}.



\subsubsection{Combining the spectra and flattening them}\label{sect:comb}
After the blaze-variation corrections, all the spectra within a night are combined in order to further boost the signal-to-noise and improve the detection limits. Each individual spectrum was weighted using the average signal-to-noise ratio provided in the header for orders \textcolor{red}{NN and MM, and OO and PP} for HARPS and UVES respectively.

%For the spectra within a given night:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%\item We median combine all the nights together.%
%
%\item Bin the spectrum and clip it, interpolate using a cubic spline.
%
%\item Divide this interpolated cubic spline into each of the nightly spectra.
%
%\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Removing the stellar spectrum}\label{sect:starcor}
The processing up to this stage removes most of the variations in the effective blaze function, but the overall stellar spectrum and, for HARPS, shape of the blaze profile, are still present and need to be removed. 

For both HARPS and UVES we first perform a second iteration of blaze corrections using a  stellar spectrum constructed by averaging the spectra from periods with a low comet activity (see \textcolor{red}{Sect.~\ref{sect:FEBident}}. For HARPS this is done separately pre- and post-fiber change. The correction is done similar to Sect.~\ref{sect:blaze}, however for both UVES and HARPS a \textcolor{red}{4th order} polynomial was used.

After this post-processing the overall (residual) blaze profile and stellar spectrum still need to be removed. Care must be taken to prevent the removal of (potential) narrow features from the circumstellar disk (as seen in e.g., the \ce{Fe} and \ion{Ca}{II} lines). This is done by combining the nightly spectra without significant cometary activity (see Sect.~\ref{sect:FEBid}) and binning this stacked spectrum in wavelength in bins of 21 pixels. Before binning, the spectrum in each bin was MAD (median absolute deviation) clipped to within $\pm$4.5 MAD of the median of the flux in the bin. The clipped average of the fluxes within each bin was used. Subsequently, the overall spectrum of the star and (residual) blaze was determined by cubic interpolation across the binned points, and divided out of the spectrum for each night. As before, for HARPS this was done separately pre- and post-fiber change.




%Subsequently, we applied a correction for variations in the instrumental blaze by selecting a reference spectrum and dividing all the spectra by this reference. The ratio was then binned, removing outliers, and a polynomial was fit to the data.
%
%For \ac{uves} we used a Nth degree polynomial, while for \ac{harps} we used a 2nd degree polynomial.
%
%This polynomial was then divided from the spectrum under consideration. We note that the blaze correction will also remove non-instrumental effects, including variations in atmospheric transmission and seeing.

%The blaze-corrected spectra taken within a night were averaged together [Should we use a weighted average?].
%
%We note that for \ac{harps}, the 2d-unmerged spectra still contain the overal instrumental blaze-profile, which is (partially) corrected for by using a dedicated blaze-frame obtained from the archive, which removes most, but not all, of this profile. 

\section{Searches for \ce{CN}}\label{sect:CNsearch}

After the initial data analysis, we proceed to with our search for lines from \ce{CN}.
%
Although we are interested in lines from the exocomets, we first co-add the data from all the individual epochs, in the stellar rest-frame, to obtain a deep search for circumstellar \ce{CN} absorption.
%
\textcolor{red}{These coadded spectra for \ac{harps} and \ac{uves} are shown in \hl{Figure}.}
%
No obvious feature from the \ce{CN} band jumps out, and we need to combine the signal from the lines within the \ce{CN} band to improve the detection limits.

Since the exocomets have a clear radial velocity with respect to \bp{}, and since each exocomet will have its own distinct velocity, we selected the NN epochs with the strongest exocometary features, a seen in the \ion{Ca}{ii} H line. 

TODO FIGURE: Just spectrum coadded in stellar rest frame same for comet rest frame in the CN band wavelength range, with the CN band overplotted.

\subsection{Identifying exocomets from \ion{Ca}{ii} H line}\label{sect:FEBid}
The comet features in the \ion{Ca}{ii} H-line ($\lambda=3968. \AA$) were identified after removing the overall stellar line-profile and avoiding the absorption from the circumstellar disk by excluding the central \textcolor{red}{NN} km\,s$^{-1}$. The deepest absorption feature in each observing night was selected, and the location and depth stored. For the comet sample we selected features deeper than \textcolor{red}{60\% and 40\%} for HARPS and UVES, respectively, while spectra with features below 15\% for both HARPS and UVES were flagged as 'low activity'. \textcolor{red}{An example of the \ion{Ca}{ii} H line for a night with a strong comet and for a night with a weak comet are shown in \hl{Figure}. The distribution of feature location and depth is shown in \hl{Figure}}

plotFEbs for the above first two figures!

The spectra for the strong comet sample were coadded, and the combined spectrum for the HARPS data is shown in \hl{Figure}. As with the circumstellar \ce{CN}, there are no obvious lines from CN visible, and we will need to combine multiple lines to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and see if there is any CN present. 
%
%The spectra with only weak exocometary features were co-averaged in the stellar rest frame in order to create a stellar master spectrum. This master-spectrum was divided out of all the remaining spectra in order to create relative spectra. 
%
%The relative velocities of the exocomets were determined by ......., and the spectra were shifted to the rest-frames of these comments, before being combined.
%
%The combined exocomet aligned spectra for both the \ce{Ca} H\&K lines and \ce{CN} band are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coadd_exocomets}. As can be seen no signal is visibly present.

\end{figure}





\subsection{Cross-correlation with \ce{CN} models}\label{sect:CCF}
To combine the signal from the many \ce{CN} lines, we cross-correlate the data for each night with a grid of model of \ce{CN}. Cross-sections for \ce{CN} were obtained from ExoMol \textcolor{red}{REFERENCES HERE} and the cross-sections were calculated using \textcolor{red}{NEED SOME DETAILS...}. We made models for a wide range of temperatures (T$=$\{10, 20, 30, 50, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000\} K) and column densities\footnote{Note that technically, for optically thin lines, this assumes a filling factor $f=1$. Since $f$ is unknown, we actually measure N$f$} (N=\{$10^{11} \ldots 10^{15}$\} cm$^{-2}$. Each of the models was then convolved to include an effective velocity dispersion using a Gaussian for FWHM=\{2.9, 5, 10, 15, 20\} km\,s$^{-1}$. A value of 2.9 km\,s$^{-1}$ corresponds approximately to the instrumental resolution of HARPS. The theoretical spectra of \ce{CN} for several different temperatures are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CN_theory}.

Even after cross-correlating, the stacked CCFs (see Fig.~\ref{fig:ccf} do not show any clear signals, and we therefore proceed to estimate our detection limits.

\subsection{Estimating the \ce{CN} column density limits}\label{sect:CNlim}
To estimate the limits on the \ce{CN} detection, we perform injection and recovery tests. We injected models for different temperatures, column densities and velocity broadening into the nightly stacked spectra (Sect.~\ref{sect:comb}, and then processed them in the same way as the original data (i.e., correct for residual blaze variations, removal of the stellar envelope and cross-correlation). This was done for all spectra with the injected signal in the stellar restframe as well as for the sample of spectra with strong cometary activity in the restframe of the strongest exocometary feature per night.

The individual CCFs show some overall slopes and offsets, and we fit each individual CCF with a combination of a second-order polynomial baseline and a Gaussian with the position fixed to 0 km\,s$^{-1}$ in its restframe. The fit has five free parameters: the amplitude of the peak, the width of the peak, and the offset, slope, and intercept of the baseline. To avoid the aliasing peaks of the \ce{CN} band (see \hl{Figure}), we only fit the central $\pm$35 km\,s$^{-1}$ of the CCF. Fitting is done using the curve\_fit function from SciPy \hl{REFERENCE}.
We correct each of the individual CCFs for the baseline and then stack the corrected CCFs to obtain our master CCF that we use for determining the upper limit. The noise on each point in the master CCF is determined by taking the standard deviation in time for each pixel and dividing that by the square root of the number of points.

This master CCF is then fitted in the same way as the nightly CCFs, and the uncertainties on the parameters is taken directly from curve\_fit assuming no covariance between the parameters. The final detection significance for the injected models is determined by the amplitude divided by its uncertainty, and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:CN_stellar_frame} for the circumstellar gas and in Figure~\ref{fig:CN_exocomet_frame} for the strongest exocomet features.
