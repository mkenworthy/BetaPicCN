The habitable zone is the region where planetary temperatures are suitable for water to exist on a planet’s surface. During the first 6 weeks of observations, Kepler monitored 156,000 stars, and five new exoplanets with sizes between 0.37 and 1.6 Jupiter radii and orbital periods from 3.2 to 4.9 days were discovered. The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher. Kepler-7b is one of the lowest-density planets ({\textasciitilde}0.17 gram per cubic centimeter) yet detected. Kepler-5b, -6b, and -8b confirm the existence of planets with densities lower than those predicted for gas giant planets.},

Accurate, empirical rovibronic energy levels with uncertainties are determined for eight doublet states of CN using the marvel (Measured Active Rotational-Vibrational Energy Levels) algorithm. 40 333 transitions were validated from 22 different published sources to generate 8083 spin-rovibronic energy levels. The empirical energy levels obtained from the marvel analysis are compared to current energy levels from the mollist line list. The mollist transition frequencies are updated with marvel energy level data which brings the frequencies obtained through experimental data up to 77.3 per cent from the original 11.3 per cent, with 92.6 per cent of the transitions with intensities over 10−23 cm molecule−1 at 1000 K now known from experimental data. At 2000 K, 100.0 per cent of the partition function is recovered using only marvel energy levels, while 98.2 per cent is still recovered at 5000 K.},

abstract = {The simulation of astronomical spectra of cool stars, brown dwarfs and exoplanets requires high resolution line lists and absorption cross sections of many molecules. Similar data sets are needed for the Earth’s atmosphere and other planets in our solar system. The requirements for line lists are reviewed and methods used to create them are discussed. Equations to convert between different units are provided. The MoLLIST (Molecular Line Lists, Intensities and Spectra) data compilation is presented and used as an example.}

Particular attention is paid to the treatment of pressure broadening parameters. The new data structure includes a definition file which provides the necessary information for utilities accessing ExoMol through its application programming interface (API).

    abstract = {Dust and gas outbursts are recurrent cometary phenomena, playing a crucial role in shaping the coma. Proposed outburst trigger mechanisms include cliff collapse, pressure pockets, and amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition of water ice; however, the underlying processes remain inadequately understood. In this study, we analyse Rosetta/ROSINA data from multiple outbursts on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and present the evolution of the gas composition in the comet’s coma during outburst events. We distinguish two distinct categories of cometary outbursts on the comet: water-driven events characterized by rapid (minutes to hours) changes in coma composition, and CO2-driven events displaying a slow, prolonged (hours to days) increase in highly volatile species. We tentatively associate these different gas composition patterns with different trigger mechanisms. Exposure of fresh ice due to cliff collapse leads to a notable water enhancement, while most perihelion outbursts coincide with substantial density increases of CO2. We propose that these CO2-driven events originate from subsurface gas-filled cavities, whose walls are suggested to have been sealed by earlier refreezing of CO2 migrating from warmer spots, hence increasing the cavity pressure required to burst.},
